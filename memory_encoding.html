<h1>Memory encoding - part 1</h1>
  <p>There are three types of encoding: semantic, visual and acoustic.</p>
  
  <h2>Semantic encoding</h2>
  <p>The encoding of words and their meaning is known as semantic encoding. It was first demonstrated by William Bousfield (1935) in an experiment where people to memorize words. 60 words were  divided into 4 categories of meaning, although the participants did not know this because the words were randomly presented. When they were asked to remember the words, they tended to recall them in categories, showing that they paid attention to the meanings of the words as they learned them.</p>

  <h2>Visual and acoustic encoding</h2>
<p>Visual encoding is the encoding of images, and acoustic encoding is the encoding of sounds, words in particular.</p>
  <p>To see how visual encoding works, read over this list of words: <i>car, level, dog, truth, book, value</i>. If you were asked later to recall the words from this list, which ones do you think you’d most likely remember? You would probably have an easier time recalling the words <i>car, dog, and book,</i> and a more difficult time recalling the words <i>level, truth, and value</i>.</p
    <p>Why is this? Because you can recall images (mental pictures) more easily than words alone. When you read the words <i>car, dog, book</i> you created images of these things in your mind. These are concrete, high-imagery words. High-imagery words are encoded both visually and semantically (Paivio, 1986), thus building a stronger memory.</p>

<p>Now let’s turn our attention to acoustic encoding. You are driving in your car and a song comes on the radio that you haven’t heard in at least 10 years, but you sing along, recalling every word. In the United States, children often learn the alphabet through song, and they learn the number of days in each month through rhyme: <blockquote>"Thirty days hath September, / April, June, and November; / All the rest have thirty-one, / Save February, with twenty-eight days clear, / And twenty-nine each leap year."</blockquote> These lessons are easy to remember because of acoustic encoding. We encode the sounds the words make.</p>

<p>Which of the three types of encoding do you think would give you the best memory of verbal information? Psychologists Fergus Craik and Endel Tulving (1975) conducted a series of experiments to find out. Participants were given words along with questions about them. The questions required the participants to process the words at one of the three levels. <ul><li>The visual processing questions included such things as asking the participants about the font of the letters.</li><li>The acoustic processing questions asked the participants about the sound or rhyming of the words,</li><li>the semantic processing questions asked the participants about the meaning of the words.</li></ul> After participants were presented with the words and questions, they were given an unexpected recall or recognition task.</p>

<p><b>Words that had been encoded semantically were better remembered than those encoded visually or acoustically.</b> Semantic encoding involves a deeper level of processing than the shallower visual or acoustic encoding. Craik and Tulving concluded that we process verbal information best through semantic encoding.</p>
